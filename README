-- Be aware this was a university project and cleanliness wasn't my best friend


This project consist to develop and compare multiple algorithms with a simple goal. Detect and classify what type of trash is on the street.
To do so, we have implemented Detectron (Mask R-CNN).

Before that we have developed data augmentation models to generate a large dataset.
